# CereNet  
**A Cerebellum / Basal Ganglia–Inspired Tumor Coordination Model**

CereNet is an R package and workflow that…
– rapidly expands multi-omic signatures into high-dimensional features  
– uses biologically-inspired plasticity rules to learn which feature-mixes matter  
– produces interpretable risk scores and in silico “knock-out” simulations  

## Overview

CereNet identifies the most predictive combinations of multi-omic signatures by projecting raw feature matrices into a high-dimensional “granule” space via random projections and then applying a cerebellum-inspired, error-driven plasticity rule (Purkinje layer) to select those mixtures most tightly linked to your phenotype of interest.
It then aggregates those gated features in a “deep-nucleus” read-out to produce interpretable coordination scores and supports rapid in silico perturbations (e.g. channel knock-outs or temporal forecasting) to simulate and validate the impact of individual signals.
