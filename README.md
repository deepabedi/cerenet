# CereNet  
**A Cerebellum / Basal Ganglia–Inspired Tumor Coordination Model**

CereNet is an R package and workflow that…
– rapidly expands multi-omic signatures into high-dimensional features  
– uses biologically-inspired plasticity rules to learn which feature-mixes matter  
– produces interpretable risk scores and in silico “knock-out” simulations  

## Installation

```r
# example install code…
